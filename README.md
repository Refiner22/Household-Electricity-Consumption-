# Electricity Consumption Prediction Project
## ‚≠ê Situation

Energy demand is growing rapidly due to industrialization, urbanization, and modern lifestyle changes. Electricity providers face major challenges in:

Maintaining grid stability during peak demand hours.

Reducing costs of energy production and distribution.

Incorporating renewable energy sources while balancing unpredictable loads.

Poor forecasting can lead to:

Underestimation ‚Üí blackouts, unstable grids, costly emergency generation.

Overestimation ‚Üí wasted resources, overproduction, and storage inefficiency.

Therefore, accurate electricity consumption forecasting is crucial for utilities, policymakers, and households.

This project applies data science and machine learning to analyze electricity consumption patterns and predict future demand.

## üéØ Task

The project was designed with the following objectives:

Data Analysis & Understanding

Explore historical consumption data.

Detect seasonal, daily, and weekly usage patterns.

Examine external factors influencing demand (e.g., temperature, day type).

Preprocessing & Feature Engineering

Prepare clean, structured data for modeling.

Generate new features like time-of-day, season, lag features, moving averages.

Handle missing values and anomalies to avoid biased predictions.

Model Development & Training

Compare classical time series models (ARIMA/SARIMA) vs. machine learning models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) vs. deep learning models (LSTM, GRU).

Optimize models using hyperparameter tuning.

Model Evaluation & Insights

Use multiple metrics (RMSE, MAE, R¬≤) for robust evaluation.

Visualize prediction accuracy across different time scales.

Identify the most significant features driving electricity usage.

## ‚ö° Action
1. Data Understanding & EDA

Loaded electricity consumption dataset from Electricity Consumption.ipynb.

Analyzed data distribution, missing values, and anomalies.

Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations:

Line plots for daily and monthly trends.

Heatmaps for correlations (e.g., temperature vs. usage).

Boxplots for detecting seasonal variations and anomalies.

## Insights:

Clear seasonal trends (summer/winter peaks).

Consumption spikes during holidays and weekends.

Higher usage during evening hours compared to mornings.

2. Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering

Data Cleaning: Filled missing values with interpolation; removed extreme outliers.

Feature Creation:

Time-based: Hour, Day, Month, Weekday/Weekend, Season.

Lag features: Previous day/week consumption.

Rolling features: Moving average, exponential smoothing.

Encoding: Converted categorical features (e.g., holiday/weekend indicators).

Scaling: Applied MinMaxScaler for neural networks (LSTM).

3. Model Development

## Classical Models:

ARIMA and SARIMA for baseline forecasting with seasonality.

Machine Learning Models:

Linear Regression ‚Üí simple benchmark.

Decision Tree & Random Forest ‚Üí interpretable and robust to non-linear trends.

Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM) ‚Üí stronger performance with structured data.

Deep Learning Models:

LSTM & GRU networks ‚Üí captured long-term dependencies in time series.

Tuned hyperparameters: learning rate, hidden units, sequence length.

## 4. Evaluation

Metrics Used:

RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) ‚Üí penalizes large errors.

MAE (Mean Absolute Error) ‚Üí average error magnitude.

R¬≤ Score ‚Üí explained variance in predictions.

## Visualization:

Actual vs Predicted line plots.

Residual plots to check bias.

Feature importance plots for tree-based models.

## üèÜ Result
Technical Outcomes

Baseline SARIMA: Captured seasonality but underperformed on long-term forecasts.

Random Forest: Strong performance, showed that lagged features were highly important.

XGBoost/LightGBM: Outperformed classical models with better RMSE and generalization.

LSTM: Best performer overall, lowest RMSE, especially effective in capturing long-term trends and short-term spikes.

Business Insights

Peak Demand: Evening hours consistently showed the highest consumption.

Seasonality: Energy spikes in summer (AC usage) and winter (heating).

Holiday Impact: Demand increased significantly during holidays, especially festive/winter holidays.

Policy Implications: Time-of-use pricing can encourage off-peak consumption.

## Impact

Improved demand forecasting enables:

Energy Providers ‚Üí better load balancing, reduced blackouts.

Policymakers ‚Üí planning for renewable integration.

Consumers ‚Üí cost savings via demand-side management.
